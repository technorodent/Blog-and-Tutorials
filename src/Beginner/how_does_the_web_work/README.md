# What happens when you view a website in your browser?
_You are about to find out_

Computers that connect to the internet are both _Clients_ and _Servers_
- A client is a computer connected to the internet that is being used by someone like you or me. On our computers we use a piece of software called a browser, usually something like Firefox or Chrome.
- A Server is a computer connected to the internet that contains sotware (webpages, sites and apps) that accepts a request for information. Server returns the requested infomration back to the computer (_client_) that made the request. 

Clients and Servers are not the end all say all. There are a more moving pieces.

## What you will learn
- TCP/IP
- DNS
- HTTP
- Component Files

### Internet : 
Everything happens through the internet. This allows you to send and receive data on the web.

### TCP/IP : 
- specifies how data should be exchanged over the internet
  - broken into packets
  - addressed
  - transmitted
  - routed
  - received at the destination
- designed to make networks reliable
  - recover automatically from the failure of any device type
- TCP (Transmission Transfer Protocol)
  - set the protocol on how applications can create channels of communication across a network
  - manages how messages are broken down into smaller packages, then transmitted, then put back together on the other side.
- IP (Internet Protocol)
  - Route the packackets created by the TCP to the correct location.
- Who created TCP/IP?
  - The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) : the research branch of the U.S. Department of Defense
  - When? 1970
  - Why? Created the model for ARPANET : A wide area network the preceded the internet. 
  - Originally designed for the Unix system
  - Now? The model is now maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force.
  
### DNS : Domain Name Service
- Like an address book for websites
- Type in a website in your browser and these things happen
  - The browsser looks at the DNS
  - The real address is found
  - The request is then sent to the correct location and the website is returned.
 
### HTTP : Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
- defines the language in which clients and servers talk to eachother

### Component Files
- Files that make up a website
  - Primary files : HTML, CSS and JavaScript
  - Assets : Images, Videos, Audio Files and PDFs are a few. 

### So what does all this mean Willis?
Here is an illustration of what exactly happens.
