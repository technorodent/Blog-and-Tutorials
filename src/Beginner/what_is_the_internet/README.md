## Creation of the internet
- The internet is a large network of computers which communicate together.
- Began in the 1960s as a Us-army funded project. The amount of data collected by the government needed a secure infrastructure in order to handle the load.
- 1980's private companies, public universities and the government added to growth of the internet
- The internet was evolved to allow large volumns of data to be shared by many compaines and the government.
- The basic idea of the internet hasn't changed, even through the technology has. The basic concept of the internet is to connect many computers together and have them stay connected no matter what.

## Step one : The internet is a network
__What is a network__
- Most basic, two computers linked together. Cables, Wireless(wifi) and bluetooth are a few
- Linking computers by cables can become a mess.
  - Lets say we have 10 coputers and each computer needs to have access to eachother. Each computer will need to have 9 cables attached to it for the other 9 computers on the network. This can become very messy as the illustration below shows.

- To simplify this we use a router

__What is a router__
- A router is a tinny computer
- You can think of a router like a traffic cop, the cop directs traffic to where it needs to go. A router directs requests to the correct connected computer.
- Each computer on our system gets connected to our router
  - this now brings the amount of cables needed from 45 down to 10.

- For example: Computer A makes a request to computer B. Computer A sends the request for information for computer B to the router. The router then forwards the request to computer B. Computer B then responds with the request back to the router. The router then sends the response from computer B to comptuer A.

__What if we had many networks that want to talk to eachother?__
- Remember, routers are computers too
- Lets say Network 1 has 5 computers and Network 2 has 5 comptuers. 
  - Each one of the computers are attached to a router on their network. 
  - We can connect routers together just like we connected computers to the router. 
  - Now Network 1 and Network 2 are connected and each one of those computers can access any of the computers on the network.

_The idea of the internet should be coming into focus now :)_

- By connecting computers to routers, then routers to ther routers, our network can then become infinite.
