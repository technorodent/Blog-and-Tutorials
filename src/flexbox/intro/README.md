# What is a Flex Container?

It is the DOM element that wraps its child elements. The __flex container__ must have a display set with either 
- display: flex
- display: inline-flex

*display: flex* : sets a block level element. This element will fill the allowed space of its containing element.

*display: inline-flex* : sets the DOM element to a  __shrink wrapped__ state. Will only be as large as its containing elements. 

# What are Flex Items?

The children of the flex container. These items can be aligned via the **Main Access** and the **Cross Access**.
