# Flex Wrap

Should your flex items wrap or stay all on one line or in one column?
Flex wrap helps you with your decision. By **default** flex is set to __no-wrap__, so your flex items will stay within one column for "column" or one row if you set the flex-direction to "row".

<br/>
Here are the available options: 

- no-wrap (default)
- wrap 
- wrap-reverse

<br />
<br />

### Set a flex-direction of row and set flex-grow.
- Should have the **flex container** take up the full width of the parent container which is the __body__.
- Set the first flex item to take up a third of the available space.
- Set all the others to take up an equal share of what is left.
- Set the flex items to wrap with __flex-wrap__ to __wrap__;
