# Flex Wrap

Should your flex items wrap or stay all on one line or in one column?
Flex wrap helps you with your decision. By **default** flex is set to __no-wrap__, so your flex items will stay within one column for "column" or one row if you set the flex-direction to "row".

<br/>
Here are the available options: 

- no-wrap (default)
- wrap 
- wrap-reverse
